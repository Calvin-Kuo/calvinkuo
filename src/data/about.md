# Introduction

I am a Software / System Engineering Manager at [AT&T](https://att.com). I am also a Master of Engineering in Engineering Management Candidate at [Cornell University](https://cornell.edu). I am particularly interested in the intersection between engineering and business management to gain a holistic view of the engineering process to define, design, and manage complex problems. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At AT&T, I am cross-functionally leading software engineering and data analyst teams to deliver 4G / 5G device diagnostics for Samsung, Qualcomm, and other OEMs. I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, and triage critical issues in the development lifecycle. As a Product Manager, I enjoy engaging with stakeholders to identify market opportunities and break complex problems down into actionable roadmaps. Serving as the critical bridge between technology and business, I have been able to touch many parts of the organization â€“from Engineering teams to Sales, Marketing, and Legal. My approach to product and project management is to experiment, build, fail fast, and think creatively and holistically to deliver game-changing technology innovations.
<br/><br/>
I focus on uncovering opportunites to create value rather than focusing on solely on backlog items. I continuously measure outcomes and decide action items based on evidence. I strive for partnership with people and nevery shy away from conflicts; I do not allow anti-patterns to get in my way. I inspire teams and empower them to solve meaningful problems however they see fit.

My hunger for continuous learning has brought me to Cornell University, where I am currently pursuing a M.Eng. in Engineering Management. On the side, I also study the financial markets and trade.

# Some History

- My parents both studied Computer Science at their universities, so I became familiar with computers from a young age.

- As a kid, I remember playing with my father's clunky laptop where I learned grammar and math. I might have endangered his business by using his computer too much.

- At 5, I began learning how to swim and ice skate competitively. After a year, I decided to stick with swimming and give up ice skating because I preferred warm sports over cold sports.

- At 6, I began Chinese school where I learned how to read, write, listen, and speak Simplified Mandarin Chinese. For the next 12 years, my Saturdays were dedicated to Chinese school (6 days of school a week). It was also the year I accidentally broke my father's Motorola Razr flip phone from using it too much.

- At 7, my parents gifted me a Gameboy for the 14 hour flight to China. Besides this being my first time visiting Asia, this was the first time I had a gaming device of any kind --so as you can imagine I was ecstatic.

- At 8, my parents bought a new Dell destop computer. I learned how to use Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, which I then used for my homework. It was also the year I began martial arts and karate.

- At 9, I began playing club soccer (or football for my friends outside the U.S.). I also created my first email account (it was a Gmail). I felt like a boss when I received my first email.

- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). It was a website for my Club Penguin and it was terrible (but I did not think so at the time). I also made Club Penguin Youtube videos which my friends still make fun of today.

- I was 11 when I learned the importance of helping my community. I participated in the Rotary International club and helped communities in Habitat for Humanity.

- When I was 12, I learned anatomy and found myself incredibly interested in pursuing a field of surgery. I was not afraid of blood, but I was afraid of shots.

- At 14, I learned about the stock market and investing concepts. My first stock was Apple [(APPL)](https://investor.apple.com/stock-price/default.aspx) as a gift from my parents. I also competed in my high school's [MarketWatch Virtual Stock Exchange Game](https://www.marketwatch.com/games) where I won 1st place. This was the start of my fever-passion for the markets.

- At 15, I was stressed about SATs, APs, extra-curriculars (i.e.: student government, volunteer hours, varsity sports, National Honor Society), and college applications. This year was a blur for me. 

- At 16, I took my first computer science course (C++) with a teacher that looked like Ghandi. I wanted to learn how to create my own games which sparked my interest in computer science. I also bought my first phone: a gold iPhone 6. I guess this was the start of me being an Apple fanboy. This year I also passed my AP Chinese exam, graduated Chinese school, and reclaimed my Saturdays.

- At 17, I bought my first laptop. It was a silver Macbook Pro. One of the first things I did with my Macbook Pro: apply to universities to study Computer Science. I also took my second computer science course (Java and OOP).

- At 18, I learned how to live independently as a Freshman at Rutgers. It was also my realization that the road to majoring in Computer Science was going to be a long and challenging one; however, I was ready.

- At 19, I got my first paying job as an Orientation Leader. That first paycheck was better than any fruity-sticker my teachers rewarded me in elementary school.

- At 20, I learned about resiliency when faced with rejection and learned to reflect, revise, and retry with my head held high. I interned as a software engineer abroad in China where I realized that my Chinese had plenty of room for improvement.

- At 21, I was selected to be a Computer Science instructor and taught my first university course. I also completed an internship with AT&T's Technology Development Program and got to work with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) for the first time.

- At 22, I graduated from Rutgers with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I joined AT&T's Technology Development Program in technical project and product management.

- At 23, while working full-time, I began pursuing my Masters degree and took my first graduate course. 

- At 24, I filed my first patent with the U.S. Patent Office.

- At 25, I am starting my market analaysis business.

# Fun Facts

- I have a passion for the stock market and have built complex spreadsheets and data visualizations to support my trading (with great returns of 17%+ YoY).
- I am an Apple geek; I follow Apple rumors, launch events, and updates like high school teens follow their favorite celebrity.
- I could juggle a soccer ball (or football for everyone outside the US) 100+ times without the ball hitting the ground.
- I have a Fear of Missing Out --better known as FOMO. Consequently, I always "go for it" so I do not have regrets later.
- I added this part because so people said my website was just my resume.

# I dream of...

- making an undeniably profound impact.
- flying a plane (and having passengers who trust me to fly a plane).
- always finding inspiration from new connections.
- enabling a brighter future for those around me.
- continuously learning to expand my horizons.
- becoming a United Airlines Million Miler (I know... it is ludicrous).
