# Introduction

I am a Software / System Engineering Manager at [AT&T](https://att.com). I am also a Master of Engineering in Engineering Management Candidate at [Cornell University](https://cornell.edu). I am particularly interested in the intersection between engineering and business management to gain a holistic view of the engineering process to define, design, and manage complex problems. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At AT&T, I am cross-functionally leading software engineering and data analyst teams to deliver 4G / 5G device diagnostics for Samsung, Qualcomm, and other OEMs. I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, and triage critical issues in the development lifecycle. As a Product Manager, I enjoy engaging with stakeholders to identify market opportunities and break complex problems down into actionable roadmaps. Serving as the critical bridge between technology and business, I have been able to touch many parts of the organization â€“from Engineering teams to Sales, Marketing, and Legal. My approach to product and project management is to experiment, build, fail fast, and think creatively and holistically to deliver game-changing technology innovations.


My hunger for continuous learning has brought me to Cornell University, where I am currently pursuing a M.Eng. in Engineering Management. On the side, I also study the financial markets and trade.

# Some History

- My parents both studied Computer Science at their universities, so I became familiar with computers from a young age.

- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.

- In . I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.

- At 7, my parents gifted me a Gameboy for the 14 hour flight to China. Besides this being my first time visiting Asia, this was the first time I had a gaming device of any kind --so as you can imagine I was ecstatic.

- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.

- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). It was a website for my Club Penguin and it was terrible (but I did not think so at the time).

- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.

- When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.

- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have contributed to two more.

- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.

- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.

- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires II.

- At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing [Muggle Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)). We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association) including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on facebook.

- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.

- At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team for the next two years. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.

# Travel / Geography

- I was born and raised in the Garden State of New Jersey.
- My current responsibilities at AT&T has me flying to Seattle, Washington quite a bit.

- In 2016, I visited: Denmark (Copenhagen), Finland (Helsinki), Germany (Berlin), Russia (St. Petersberg), Swedan (Stockholm).
- In 2017, I visited: Hawaii (Honolulu, Maui), Virginia, Washington D.C.

# Odd Things I Have Learned
- Social Security Numbers were not meant to be used for US citizen identification.
- There is a ladder in Jerusalem that could start a war if moved.

# Fun Facts

- I have a passion for the stock market and have built complex spreadsheets and data visualizations to support my trading (with great returns of 17%+ YoY).
- I am an Apple geek; I follow Apple rumors, launch events, and updates like high school teens follow their favorite celebrity.
- I could juggle a soccer ball (or football for everyone outside the US) 100+ times without the ball hitting the ground.
- I am susceptable to Fear of Missing Out --better known as FOMO. Consequently, I always "go for it" when possible so I do not have regrets later.
- I added this part because so people said my website was just my resume.

# I dream of

- making an undeniably profound impact.
- flying a plane (and having passengers who trust me to fly a plane).
- always finding inspiration from new connections.
- enabling a brighter future for those around me.
- continuously learning to expand my horizons.
- becoming a United Airlines Million Miler (I know... it is ludicrous)
