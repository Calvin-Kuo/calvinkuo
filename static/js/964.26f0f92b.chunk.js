I work at the intersection between engineering and business management to holistically orchestrate the engineering process to define, design, and manage complex problems. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\nI have a Master of Engineering in Engineering Management at [Cornell University](https://cornell.edu).\n\n# Currently\n\nAt AT&T, I am cross-functionally leading software engineering and data analyst teams to deliver 4G / 5G device diagnostics for Samsung, Qualcomm, and other OEMs. I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, and triage critical issues in the development lifecycle. As a Product Manager, I enjoy engaging with stakeholders to identify market opportunities and break complex problems down into actionable roadmaps. Serving as the critical bridge between technology and business, I have been able to touch many parts of the organization \u2013from Engineering teams to Sales, Marketing, and Legal. My approach to product and project management is to experiment, build, fail fast, and think creatively and holistically to deliver game-changing technology innovations.\n<br/><br/>\nI focus on uncovering opportunites to create value rather than focusing on solely on backlog items. I continuously measure outcomes and decide action items based on evidence. I strive for partnership with people and nevery shy away from conflicts; I do not allow anti-patterns to get in my way. I inspire teams and empower them to solve meaningful problems however they see fit. \n<br/><br/>\nMy hunger for continuous learning has brought me to Cornell University, where I am currently pursuing a M.Eng. in Engineering Management. On the side, I also study the financial markets and trade.\n\n# Some History\n\n- My parents both studied Computer Science at their universities, so I became familiar with computers from a young age.\n\n- As a kid, I remember playing with my father's clunky laptop where I learned grammar and math. I might have endangered his business by using his computer too much.\n\n- At 5, I began learning how to swim and ice skate competitively. After a year, I decided to stick with swimming and give up ice skating because I preferred warm sports over cold sports.\n\n- At 6, I began Chinese school where I learned how to read, write, listen, and speak Simplified Mandarin Chinese. For the next 12 years, my Saturdays were dedicated to Chinese school (6 days of school a week). It was also the year I accidentally broke my father's Motorola Razr flip phone from using it too much.\n\n- At 7, my parents gifted me a Gameboy for the 14 hour flight to China. Besides this being my first time visiting Asia, this was the first time I had a gaming device of any kind --so as you can imagine I was ecstatic.\n\n- At 8, my parents bought a new Dell destop computer. I learned how to use Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, which I then used for my homework. It was also the year I began martial arts and karate.\n\n- At 9, I began playing club soccer (or football for my friends outside the U.S.). I also created my first email account (it was a Gmail). I felt like a boss when I received my first email.\n\n- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). It was a website for my Club Penguin and it was terrible (but I did not think so at the time). I also made Club Penguin Youtube videos which my friends still make fun of today.\n\n- I was 11 when I learned the importance of helping my community. I participated in the Rotary International club and helped communities in Habitat for Humanity.\n\n- When I was 12, I learned anatomy and found myself incredibly interested in pursuing a field of surgery. I was not afraid of blood, but I was afraid of shots.\n\n- At 14, I learned about the stock market and investing concepts. My first stock was Apple [(APPL)](https://investor.apple.com/stock-price/default.aspx) as a gift from my parents. I also competed in my high school's [MarketWatch Virtual Stock Exchange Game](https://www.marketwatch.com/games) where I won 1st place. This was the start of my fever-passion for the markets.\n\n- At 15, I was stressed about SATs, APs, extra-curriculars (i.e.: student government, volunteer hours, varsity sports, National Honor Society), and college applications. This year was a blur for me. \n\n- At 16, I took my first computer science course (C++) with a teacher that looked like Ghandi. I wanted to learn how to create my own games which sparked my interest in computer science. I also bought my first phone: a gold iPhone 6. I guess this was the start of me being an Apple fanboy. This year I also passed my AP Chinese exam, graduated Chinese school, and reclaimed my Saturdays.\n\n- At 17, I bought my first laptop. It was a silver Macbook Pro. One of the first things I did with my Macbook Pro: apply to universities to study Computer Science. I also took my second computer science course (Java and OOP).\n\n- At 18, I learned how to live independently as a Freshman at Rutgers. It was also my realization that the road to majoring in Computer Science was going to be a long and challenging one; however, I was ready.\n\n- At 19, I got my first paying job as an Orientation Leader. That first paycheck was better than any fruity-sticker my teachers rewarded me in elementary school.\n\n- At 20, I learned about resiliency when faced with rejection and learned to reflect, revise, and retry with my head held high. I interned as a software engineer abroad in China where I realized that my Chinese had plenty of room for improvement.\n\n- At 21, I was selected to be a Computer Science instructor and taught my first university course. I also completed an internship with AT&T's Technology Development Program and got to work with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) for the first time.\n\n- At 22, I graduated from Rutgers with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I joined AT&T's Technology Development Program in technical project and product management.\n\n- At 23, while working full-time, I began pursuing my Masters degree and took my first graduate course. \n\n- At 24, I filed my first patent with the U.S. Patent Office.\n\n- At 25, I am starting my market analaysis business.\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm hesitant to share with the Internet.\n\n# I like...\n\n- Investing / Trading Stocks\n- Soccer\n- Swimming\n- Airplanes\n- Traveling\n- Food (if you got a recommendation, please reach out)\n- Learning new things\n- Podcasts ([The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily), [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/), [The Indicator](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/), [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episodes/), [The Economist](http://radio.economist.com/), [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab), [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain), [Inquiring Minds](https://inquiring.show), and others)\n- [Good design](/)\n- Friendly and Driven People :D\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I was born and raised in the Garden State of New Jersey.\n- My current responsibilities at AT&T sometimes sees me flying to Seattle, Washington.\n- I have been to ~ 20 countries, a few of which are a little fuzzy in my memory, and many of which I would like to revisit (especially Japan).\n- In 2016, I visited: Denmark (Copenhagen), Finland (Helsinki), Germany (Berlin), Russia (St. Petersberg), Sweden (Stockholm).\n- In 2017, I visited: Hawaii (Honolulu, Maui), Virginia, Washington D.C.\n- In 2018, I did a software engineering internship in Beijing, China which gave me the opportunity to explore: Hong Kong, Shanghai, Fuzhou, and Japan (Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto).\n- In 2019, I visited: Florida (Miami).\n- In 2020, I barely traveled 200 feet.
