I am also a Master of Engineering in Engineering Management Candidate at [Cornell University](https://cornell.edu). I am particularly interested in the intersection between engineering and business management to gain a holistic view of the engineering process to define, design, and manage complex problems. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt AT&T, I am cross-functionally leading software engineering and data analyst teams to deliver 4G / 5G device diagnostics for Samsung, Qualcomm, and other OEMs. I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, and triage critical issues in the development lifecycle. As a Product Manager, I enjoy engaging with stakeholders to identify market opportunities and break complex problems down into actionable roadmaps. Serving as the critical bridge between technology and business, I have been able to touch many parts of the organization \u2013from Engineering teams to Sales, Marketing, and Legal. My approach to product and project management is to experiment, build, fail fast, and think creatively and holistically to deliver game-changing technology innovations.\n\n\nMy hunger for continuous learning has brought me to Cornell University, where I am currently pursuing a M.Eng. in Engineering Management. On the side, I also study the financial markets and trade.\n\n# Some History\n\n- My parents both studied Computer Science at their universities, so I became familiar with computers from a young age.\n\n- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.\n\n- In . I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.\n\n- At 7, my parents gifted me a Gameboy for the 14 hour flight to China. Besides this being my first time visiting Asia, this was the first time I had a gaming device of any kind --so as you can imagine I was ecstatic.\n\n- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.\n\n- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). It was a website for my Club Penguin and it was terrible (but I did not think so at the time).\n\n- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.\n\n- When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.\n\n- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have contributed to two more.\n\n- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.\n\n- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.\n\n- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires II.\n\n- At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing [Muggle Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)). We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association) including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on facebook.\n\n- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.\n\n- At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team for the next two years.
